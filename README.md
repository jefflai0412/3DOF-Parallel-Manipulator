# 3DOF-Parallel-Manipulator

# Project Overview

This project contains multiple modules and scripts for different functionalities. Below is a summary table of each folder and its corresponding purpose.

| Folder Name                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `01_controlled_by_IMU`       | Code to control the system using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).        |
| `10_controlled_by_vision`    | Code to control the system based on computer vision or camera input.        |
| `controlled_by_joystick`     | Code to enable control of the system using a joystick. You have to run this with `joystick.py`                   |
| `controlled_by_serial`       | Code for serial communication-based control of the system.                 |
| `encoder_distance`           | Code to measure and utilize distance data from encoders.                   |
| `i2c_scanner`                | A script to scan and identify devices connected via the I2C bus.           |
| `IMU_test`                   | Test code for evaluating IMU performance and accuracy.                     |
| `libraries`                  | Collection of external or custom libraries used across the project.        |
| `serial_test`                | Script to test serial communication between devices.                       |
| `servo_control`              | Code for controlling servo motors for precise movements.                  |
